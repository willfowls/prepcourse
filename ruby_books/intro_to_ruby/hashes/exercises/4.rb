# Given the following expression, how would you access the name of the person?

person = {name: 'Bob', occupation: 'web developer', hobbies: 'painting'}

puts person[:name]

# Below is my initial attempt. Above is solution from book. Felt kind of dumb on this one, felt like it should've been
# one of the easier ones. Still happy about number 3

#person = {name: 'Bob', occupation: 'web developer', hobbies: 'painting'}

#person.fetch('Bob')
