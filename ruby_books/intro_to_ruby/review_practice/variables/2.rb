# write a program called age that asks user age and tells how old they will be in 10,20,30,40 years.

puts "What is your age?"
age = gets.chomp.to_i

puts "In 10 yeqrs you will be:"
puts age + 10

puts "In 20 years you will be:"
puts age + 20

puts "In 30 years you will be:"
puts age + 30

puts "In 40 years you will be:"
puts age + 40

# got lines 3 and 4 right, started defining variables such as x for age + 10 but could not figure out a solution
# had to refer to solution on launch school
