# write a program that includes a method called multiply that takes two arguments and returns product of the two numbers

def multiply(number1, number2)
    number1 * number2
end

puts multiply(80*1000)


## below is my initial attempt in note form. had to refer to solution, still felt okay about  attempt though, had right idea

#x = 3
#y = 4

#def multiply
#   x * y
#end

#puts multiply
