# given the followin code
#x = "hi there"
#my_hash = {x: "some value"}
#my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}
# what's the difference between the two hashes that were created
p x = "hi there"
p my_hash = {x: "some value"}
p my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

# the first hash that was created used a symbol x as the key. the ssecond hash used the string value of the x variable as key
