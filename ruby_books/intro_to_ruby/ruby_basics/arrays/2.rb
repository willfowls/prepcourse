# in the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets
#Write some code that selects 'fish' and 'lizard' from the pets array - select the two items at the same time. 
#Assign the return value to a variable named my_pets, then print the contents of my_pets as a single string, e.g.:

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

my_pet = pets[2,3]

puts "I have a pet #{my_pet[0]} and a pet #{my_pet[1]}!"
