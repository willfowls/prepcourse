# The code below is an example of an infinite loop. The name describes exactly what it does: loop infinitely.
# This loop isn't useful in a real program though. Modify code so loop stops after first iteration.

loop do 
    puts 'Just keep printing...'
    break
end

# We added the break function after the loop to stop after the first iteration.
