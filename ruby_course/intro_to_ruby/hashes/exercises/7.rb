# If you see this error, what do you suspect is the most likely problem?

#NoMethodError: undefined method `keys' for Array

# This means that there is not a defined method for keys. It was not specified how keys be used. Also i'm not sure we use
# keys in arrays? we'll see per solution

# Problem per book -- 1.) We're missing keys in an array variable 
# 2.) There is no method called keys for array aboject (guessed that)
# 3.) keys is an array object, but hasn't been defined yet (guessed that)
# 4.) there's an array of strings, and we're trying to get the string keys out of the array, but it doesn't exist
