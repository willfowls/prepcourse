# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# The easiest way for me to describe it is with an example. Say we define a method that is looking for strings, though
# we enter an integer. If we don't have a rescue method in place to output an error message to the user, it will
# ruin the rest of the code and we will get error messages including code problems
# exception is a great way to find bugs in the code and communicate to the user that these values can't be used

# my answer is above, book solution is below

# Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. 
# It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
