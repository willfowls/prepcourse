# What's the major difference between an array and a hash?

# an array stores one piece of information at a time such as [1,2,3,4]
# a hash stores multiple pieces of information such as family = {parents: "dad", "mom",
                                                                    # brothers: "matt", "luke" }

# According to launch school solution the answer is 
# The major difference between an array and hash is that hash contains key value pair for referencing by key
# which is a more accurate description of what i was trying to say

# array uses index [0,1,2,3] to decide which value to choose, while hashes uses keys such as "parents" example above to list values
